My name is Kirill Rekhov (nicknames: **iikrllx**, **krekhov**). I'm a software engineer who greatly appreciates and respects the free software movement. I love open source. I am an advanced [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) user and [volunteer](https://www.debian.org/intro/help.en.html) (this is my hobby). I also really love the game Quake 3 Arena and play it in my free time on Debian. Thank you for your attention.
