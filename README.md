My name is Kirill Rekhov (nicknames: **krekhovx**, **krekhov**). I'm a software engineer who values the free software movement and loves open source. I'm an advanced [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) user and [contributor](https://www.debian.org/intro/help.en.html), volunteer, and currently a [Debian Maintainer](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) â€” all as part of my hobbies. I write in C and Bash, have a passion for shell scripting, and prefer minimalist terminals and environments. I'm a fan of Vim and its hotkeys. In my free time, I play multiplayer [Quake 3 Arena](https://ioquake3.org/) on Debian.
