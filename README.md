My name is Kirill Rekhov (nicknames: **krekhovx**, **krekhov**). I'm a software engineer who greatly appreciates and respects the free software movement while also loving open source. I'm an advanced [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) user, [contributor](https://www.debian.org/intro/help.en.html), and volunteer (these are my hobbies). I write in C, Bash, have a passion for Shell. I have a strong affection for minimalist terminals and environments. I absolutely love the Vim editor (its crazy hotkeys). In my free time, I play multiplayer [Quake 3 Arena](https://ioquake3.org/) on Debian. Thank you for your attention.
